a function that returns the size of the database. 
Maybe returns a tuple: (m,n,p) with m the number
of files, n the number of cubes and p the number
of coordinates??

check that all this has the same length:
print(len(all_cubes.datafiles),
      len(all_cubes.cubes),
	        len(all_cubes.coordinates))
