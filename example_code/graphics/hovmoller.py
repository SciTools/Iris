Hovmoller diagram of monthly surface temperature
================================================

This example demonstrates the creation of a Hovmoller diagram with fine control over plot ticks and labels.
The data file being loaded is daily SST from the Met Office OSTIA project. As the plot is designed to show
annual variability, monthly data would be sufficient, therefore a constraint is used to filter all data which
does not fall on the first day of the month. A more sophisticated filtering scheme could be applied in practice,
perhaps taking the monthly mean as the data to plot.
