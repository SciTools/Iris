    Page should briefly demonstrate how to do the most popular Iris operations
     with UGRID data.
    * Start with summary table listing the operations, indicating if anything
       is different or so-far-impossible with UGRID data. Each row should link
       to the section (so it's an enhanced TOC).
    * Mention the ugrid_partners page at the beginning and/or within applicable
       demo sections.
    * Demo of each operation.
    * Operations planned for the future.
