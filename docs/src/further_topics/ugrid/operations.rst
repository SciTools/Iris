.. _ugrid operations:

Working with UGRID Data
***********************

.. note:: Several of the operations below rely on the optional dependencies
          mentioned in :doc:`partner_packages`.

..
    Have a table here that lists the headings below, including a small note
     about whether it's unchanged (e.g. Saving), has to be done differently
     (e.g. Extraction), or isn't yet possible (e.g. Arithmetic). Each row
     should link to the section below. Basically an enhanced TOC.

..
    Below: use demo code over prose wherever workable. Headings aren't an
     exhaustive list (can you think of any other popular operations?).
