    The conventions page is [necessarily] not for a layperson. This is an
     opportunity to explain UGRID at an Iris user's level - doesn't need to be
     exhaustive, just get across what is needed for the user to understand why
     their experience will be different to 'normal'.
    * Describe what is different about the UGRID model.
    * Relate to the objects in Iris' model.
    * Relate to the printout of a Cube-with-Mesh. Possibly also the printout
       of a Mesh, if that has been fixed to not be enormous.
