    The conventions page is [necessarily] not for a layperson. This is an
     opportunity to explain UGRID at an Iris user's level - doesn't need to be
     exhaustive, just get across what is needed for the user to understand why
     their experience will be different to 'normal'.


The UGRID Data Model
********************

What's Different?
=================

..
    IDEA: The unstructured mesh format maximises flexibility, but means that no
     spatial information can be inferred from a structured data array. Much
     less is implicit, much more information has to be stored explicitly.

    Diagram(s) - SVG so editable later.

How Iris Represents This
========================

..
    Include API links to the various classes

    Include Cube/Mesh printout(s)
