üì¢ Announcements
================

#. N/A


‚ú® Features
===========

#. `@rcomer`_ rewrote :func:`~iris.util.broadcast_to_shape` so it now handles
   lazy data. (:pull:`5307`)
   
#. `@acchamber`_   added error and warning messages about coordinate overlaps to 
   :func:`~iris.cube.concatenate` to improve the concatenation process. (:pull:`5382`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ included mesh location coordinates
   (e.g. :attr:`~iris.experimental.ugrid.Mesh.face_coords`) in
   the data variable's ``coordinates`` attribute when saving to NetCDF.
   (:issue:`5206`, :pull:`5389`)

#. `@pp-mo`_ modified the install process to record the release version of the CF
   standard-names table, when it creates the ``iris/std_names.py`` module.
   The release number is also now available as
   ``iris.std_names.CF_STANDARD_NAMES_TABLE_VERSION``.
   (:pull:`5423`)


üêõ Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@acchamber`_ fixed a bug with :func:`~iris.util.unify_time_units` so it does not block
   concatenation through different data types in rare instances. (:pull:`5372`) 

#. `@acchamber`_ removed some obsolete code that prevented extraction of time points
   from cubes with bounded times (:pull:`5175`)
   
#. `@rcomer`_ modified pp-loading to avoid a ``cftime`` warning for non-standard
   calendars. (:pull:`5357`)


üí£ Incompatible Changes
=======================

#. N/A


üöÄ Performance Enhancements
===========================

#. `@rcomer`_ made :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.aggregated_by` faster. (:pull:`4970`)
#. `@rsdavies`_ modified the CF compliant standard name for m01s00i023 (:issue:`4566`)

üî• Deprecations
===============

#. N/A


üîó Dependencies

#. N/A


üìö Documentation
================

#. `@tkknight`_ prepared the documentation for dark mode and enable the option
   to use it.  By default the theme will be based on the users system settings,
   defaulting to ``light`` if no system setting is found.  (:pull:`5299`)

#. `@HGWright`_ added a :doc:`/further_topics/dask_best_practices/index`
   section into the user guide, containing advice and use cases to help users
   get the best out of Dask with Iris.  (:pull:`5190`)

#. `@acchamber`_ improved documentation for :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.convert_units`
   and :meth:`~iris.coords.Coord.convert_units` by including a link to the UDUNITS-2
   documentation which contains lists of compatible units and aliases for them.
  (:pull:`5388`)


#. `@rcomer`_ updated the :ref:`Installation Guide<installing_iris>` to reflect
   that some things are now simpler.  (:pull:`5416`)

üíº Internal
===========

#. `@pp-mo`_ supported loading and saving netcdf :class:`netCDF4.Dataset` compatible
   objects in place of file-paths, as hooks for a forthcoming
   `"Xarray bridge" <https://github.com/SciTools/iris/issues/4994>`_ facility.
   (:pull:`5214`, :pull:`5212`)

#. `@rcomer`_ updated :func:`~iris.plot.contourf` to avoid using functionality
   that is deprecated in Matplotlib v3.8 (:pull:`5405`)
