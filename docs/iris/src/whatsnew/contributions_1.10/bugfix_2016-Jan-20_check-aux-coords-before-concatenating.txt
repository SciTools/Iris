* Concatenation no longer occurs when the auxilliary coordinates of the cubes do not match. This check is not applied to AuxCoords that span the dimension the concatenation is occuring along. This behaviour can be switched off by setting the ``check_aux_coords`` kwarg in :meth:`iris.cube.CubeList.concatenate` to False.
