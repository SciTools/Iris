.. _iris_grib_added:

* Support has now been added for the
  `iris_grib <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib>`_ package, which
  provides GRIB format support in an optional package, separate from Iris.

  * If 'iris_grib' is available, it will always be used in place of the older
    iris module :mod:`iris.fileformats.grib`.

  * The capabilities of 'iris_grib' are essentially the same as the existing
    'iris.fileformats.grib' when used with 'iris.FUTURE.strict_grib_load=True',
    with only small detail differences.

  * The old 'iris.fileformats.grib' module is now deprecated and may shortly be
    removed.

    * If you are already using the recommended :data:`iris.FUTURE` setting
      "iris.FUTURE.strict_grib_load=True" this should not cause problems, as
      the new package is all-but identical.

      * However, the option "iris.FUTURE.strict_grib_load" is itself now
        deprecated, so you should remove code that sets it.

    * If, however, your code is still using the older "non-strict" grib
      loading, then you may need to make code changes.

      * In particular, the 'field' object passed to load callbacks is
        different.
        See :class:`iris.fileformats.grib.message.GribMessage` (the
        "iris_grib.message.GribMessage" class is the same as this, for now).

  * Please exercise your code with the new iris_grib module, and let us know of
    any problems you uncover, such as files that will no longer load with the
    new implementation.
