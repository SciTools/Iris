* Cube data equality testing (and hence cube equality) now uses a more relaxed
  tolerance : This means that some cubes may now test 'equal' that previously
  did not.
  Previously, Iris compared cube data arrays using "abs(a - b) < 1.e-8".
  We now apply the default operation of :func:`numpy.allclose` instead,
  which is equivalent to "abs(a - b) < (1.e-8 + 1.e-5 * b)".
