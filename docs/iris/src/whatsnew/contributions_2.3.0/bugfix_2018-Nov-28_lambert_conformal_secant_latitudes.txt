* Fixed a bug where plotting a cube with a
  :class:`iris.coord_systems.LamberConformal` coordinate system would result
  in an error.  This would happen if the coordinate system was defined with one
  standard parallel, rather than two.
  In these cases, a call to
  :meth:`~iris.coord_systems.LambertConform.as_cartopy_crs` would fail.
