* New coordinate system: :class:`iris.coord_systems.Geostationary`, based on
the `CF Geostationary projection definition <http://cfconventions
.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#_geostationary_projection>`_.
* :class:`iris.coord_systems.VerticalPerspective` coordinate system now uses
the `CF Vertical perspective definition <http://cfconventions
.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#vertical-perspective>`_; had been
erroneously using Geostationary.
