* Fixed a bug in the :data:`~iris.analysis.PROPORTION` aggregator, where cube
  data in the form of a masked array with "array.mask=False" would cause an
  error, but possibly only later when the values are actually realised.
  ( Note: since netCDF4 version 1.4.0, this is now a common form for data
  loaded from netCDF files ).
