* Statistical operations :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.collapsed`,
  :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.aggregated_by` and :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.rolling_window`
  previously removed every :class:`iris.coord.CellMeasure` attached to the cube.
  Now, a :class:`iris.coord.CellMeasure` will only be removed if it is associated
  with an axis over which the statistic is being run.
