* The area weights used when performing area weighted regridding with :class:`iris.analysis.AreaWeighted`
  are now cached.
  This allows a significant speedup when regridding multiple similar cubes, by repeatedly using
  a `'regridder' object <../iris/iris/analysis.html?highlight=regridder#iris.analysis.AreaWeighted.regridder>`_
  which you created first.
