* Users can now check their cubes for any discontiguities in bounds arrays
using the function :func:`iris.util.find_discontiguities_in_bounds`.
Additionally, users can choose to mask their data at discontiguous points
with the function :func:`iris.util.mask_data_at_discontiguities`, which could
prevent plotting errors in some cases.
