* When saving to NetCDF, the existing behaviour of writing string attributes as ASCII has been
  maintained across all versions of netCDF4-python. Where an attribute can not be encoded as ASCII
  it will be passed through to the underlying netCDF4-python as unicode, and the behaviour will be
  netCDF4-python version dependent (since v1.2 unicode are written as a NC_STRING rather than NC_CHAR type).
