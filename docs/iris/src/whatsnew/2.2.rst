Iris 2.2.0 Features
===================
.. _showcase:

.. admonition:: 2-Dimensional Coordinate Plotting

  The iris plot functions :func:`~iris.plot.pcolor` and
  :func:`~iris.plot.pcolormesh` now accommodate the plotting of 2-dimensional
  coordinates as well as 1-dimensional coordinates.

  To enable this feature, each coordinate passed in for plotting will be
  automatically checked for contiguity.  Coordinate bounds must either be
  contiguous, or the cube's data must be masked at the discontiguities in
  order to avoid plotting errors.

  The iris plot functions :func:`iris.plot.quiver` has been added, and this
  also works with 2-dimensional plot coordinates.

.. admonition:: 2-Dimensional Grid Vectors

  The iris functions :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.gridcell_angles` and
  :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.rotate_grid_vectors` have been added,
  allowing you to convert gridcell-oriented vectors to true-North/East ones.
