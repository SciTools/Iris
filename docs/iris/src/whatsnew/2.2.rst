What's New in Iris 2.2.0
************************

:Release: 2.2.0
:Date:


This document explains the new/changed features of Iris in the release
of version 2.2.0
(:doc:`View all changes <index>`).


Iris 2.2.0 Features
===================
.. _showcase:

.. admonition:: 2-Dimensional Coordinate Plotting

  The iris plot functions :func:`~iris.plot.pcolor` and
  :func:`~iris.plot.pcolormesh` now accommodate the plotting of 2-dimensional
  coordinates as well as 1-dimensional coordinates.

  To enable this feature, each coordinate passed in for plotting will be
  automatically checked for contiguity.  Coordinate bounds must either be
  contiguous, or the cube's data must be masked at the discontiguities in
  order to avoid plotting errors.

  The iris plot function :func:`iris.plot.quiver` has been added, and this
  also works with 2-dimensional plot coordinates.

.. admonition:: 2-Dimensional Grid Vectors

  The iris functions :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.gridcell_angles` and
  :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.rotate_grid_vectors` have been added,
  allowing you to convert gridcell-oriented vectors to true-North/East ones.

* The :class:`iris.fileformats.um.FieldCollation` objects, which are passed
  into load callbacks when using
  :func:`iris.fileformats.um.structured_um_loading`, now
  have the additional properties:
  :data:`iris.fileformats.um.FieldCollation.data_filepath` and
  :data:`iris.fileformats.um.FieldCollation.data_field_indices`.
  These provide the file locations of the original data fields, which are
  otherwise lost in the structured loading process.

* NetCDF data variable chunk sizes are utilised at load time for significant
  performance improvements.

* :func:`iris.util.reverse` can now be used to reverse a cube by specifying
  one or more coordinates.


Iris 2.1 Dependency updates
===========================

* Iris is now using the latest version release of Dask (currently 0.19.3)

*

Bugs Fixed
==========

* Fixed a bug that prevented printing time coordinates with bounds when the
  time coordinate was measured on a long interval (that is, ``months``
  or ``years``).

* "Gracefully filling..." warnings are now only issued when the co-ordinate or
  bound data is actually masked.
