Iris 1.12 Features
==================
.. _showcase:

.. admonition:: Showcase Feature - Dask Interfacing

  Iris' data processing sidekick Biggus has been replaced by the titan of
  parallel processing, dask.

  This change will not affect Iris' API or behaviour unless the user
  specifically requests it by interfacing with dask's user options (see
  :doc:`user_guide_real_and_lazy_data` and the accompanying Whitepaper for
  full details).

  If you wanted to make use of the extra functionality that dask can offer,
  here are some of the features which you could benefit from:

  * Ability to load and manipulate larger datasets
  * Options for parallel processing (scheduler type, number of processors etc.)
  * Parallelization of simple computations using dask.bag and/or dask.chunks
  * Dask graphs?


Bug Fixes
=========
* New cell measures are now constructed as copies of the parent data rather than views of them.
* Sliced coordinates no longer share data with their parent coordinate.


Deprecations
============
* Iris-grib as an external package?
* Something about iris.FUTURE stuff?


Documentation Changes
=====================
* New User Guide section about real and lazy data added.
