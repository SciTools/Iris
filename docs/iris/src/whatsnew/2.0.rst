This document explains the new/changed features of Iris in version 2.0
(:doc:`View all changes <index>`.)

Iris 1.12 Features
==================
.. _showcase:

.. admonition:: Showcase Feature - Iris-Dask Interfacing

  **Iris' data processing sidekick Biggus has been replaced by the titan of
  parallel processing, dask.**

  The primary advantage of this replacement is the ability to load and
  manipulate larger datasets than ever before.  However, it also gives users
  the ability to apply other dask features (such as parallelisation) to Iris.

  This change will not affect Iris' API or behaviour unless the user
  specifically requests it by interfacing with dask's user options (see
  :doc:`user_guide_real_and_lazy_data` and the accompanying Whitepaper for
  full details).


Bug Fixes
=========
* New cell measures are now constructed as copies of their parent data rather than views of them.
* Sliced coordinates no longer share data with their parent coordinate.


Deprecations
============
* The previously deprecated use of Iris internal Grib loading has been reinstated.  The use of Iris-grib as an external package is now deprecated instead.
* The ability to share data between cubes using the :meth:`iris.cube.share_data` flag has been temporarily removed pending a compatible implementation.
* Something about iris.FUTURE stuff?


Documentation Changes
=====================
* New User Guide section about real and lazy data added.
