* A skip pattern is introduced to the fields file loader, such that fields
  which cannot be turned into iris PPField instances are skipped and the
  remaining fields are loaded.  This especially applies to certain types of
  files that can contain fields with a non-standard LBREL value : Iris can now
  load such a file, skipping the unreadable field and printing a warning
  message.
