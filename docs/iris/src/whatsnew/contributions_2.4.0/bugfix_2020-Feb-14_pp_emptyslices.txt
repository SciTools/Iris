* Fixed a problem which was causing file loads to fetch *all* field data
  whenever UM files (PP or Fieldsfiles) were loaded.
  With large sourcefiles, initial file loads are slow, with large memory usage
  before any cube data is even fetched.  Large enough files will cause a crash.
  The problem occurs only with Dask versions >= 2.0.
