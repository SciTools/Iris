Installing Iris currently requires you to build it from source.  The dependencies must be 
in place to suport this process.

.. _install_from_source:

Installing from source
======================

The latest release is available from `github <https://github.com/SciTools/iris>`__

Once you have satisfied the requirements detailed below 
you can build Iris::

  cd iris
  python setup.py install


To get help with setup::

  python setup.py --help
  python setup.py --help-commands


.. _install_requirements:

Build requirements
==================

These are external packages which you will need to install before
installing Iris. 


Many of these packages are available in Linux package management systems,
such as python-numpy for Debian and Ubuntu

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux, 
you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev" postfix) 
in addition to the libraries themselves.


python 2.7 (or later but not python3)
    Iris requires python 2.7 or later (`download <http://www.python.org/download/>`__)

numpy 1.6 (or later)
    array support for python (`download <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`__)

scipy 0.10 or later
    scientific analysis (`download <http://www.scipy.org>`__)

udunits2 2.1.24 or later
    (`downloads <ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/udunits/>`__)

netcdf4-python 0.9.9 or later
    (`download <http://netcdf4-python.googlecode.com/>`__)

**Optional**

These are optional packages which you may want to install to use
Iris with different file formats and to enable plotting functionality.
All of these are required for the Iris test suite to run.

    (`download <http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/download/grib_api.html>`__)

    A compression library such as Jasper is required to read JPEG2000 compressed GRIB2 files.

matplotlib 1.1.0

Packaged Distributions
=======================

The Enthought Python Distribution `(EPD)
<http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ for Windows, OS X or
Redhat provides some of the dependencies for Iris as does `Python (x, y)
<http://www.pythonxy.com/foreword.php>`_ which tends to be updated a
bit more frequently.
